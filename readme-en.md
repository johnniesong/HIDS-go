# Introduction
A HIDS developed in Go for intrusion detection and monitoring. The last update was in 2019, so its effectiveness is certainly not comparable to continuously iterating commercial products.

It has the following features:

1. Self-learning capabilities for host commands, continuously learning to whitelist high-load process calls, reducing CPU consumption while having negligible memory usage. It also has a CPU consumption limit function, currently limiting it to 10%.
2. Deployed on over 70,000 servers with stable performance. Mainly compatible with CentOS 6 and 7.
3. Detection based on auditd logs, analyzing key behaviors associated with backdoors. The core principle of intrusion detection is to identify anomalies. For instance, a backdoor in use will have network communication and process execution, so these behaviors will differ from normal communication and processes on the host or even in the cluster. Extracting and identifying these anomalies is the essence of effective intrusion detection.
4. Having practical experience in internal offense and defense, with three real backdoor detections and one hidden mining detection.

# Dependencies
The system must have the auditd service enabled.
The ss command is considerably more efficient than netstat and is very important. (CentOS: yum update iproute)

# Backend server
Modify the LOGServer IP address in core/config.go to receive alert information.

# Running
Run build.sh to generate the executable file in the bin directory.
tools/deploy.sh is used for deployment through the agent, currently compatible with CentOS 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Thereâ€™s an option in the config called isCheckOwnAsset to check if the target IP for network connections is a trusted asset. This feature is disabled in the open-source project and will return "no" by default. Further modifications can be made if needed.
Others
tools/check_high_call.py is used for analyzing high-performance-consuming process calls during development. The analysis file is the log generated by hids-go.
